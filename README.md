# PyBer_Analysis
### Ride-sharing analysis

## Project Overview 

### Purpose

The purpose of this study was to explore data obtained by PyBer, a ride-sharing company, to further look into the total weekly fares of different city types that PyBer services. The average fares were grouped into one of three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The different city types were used to create data visualizations to better understand how PyBer should promote access to ride sharing, as well as understanding how affordable rides are based on the area's population and density of said population.
